    <description>An MSBuild project integration that makes it easy to keep version numbers synced across all projects in a solution based on a simple date scheme and user provided major / minor version numbers.  Provides a single source of truth for versioning, and modifies it at build time as necessary to keep assembly metadata fresh.</description>

    <releaseNotes>
        * Removed MSBuild-y ness from version.props since its extraneous and confuses things (breaking change)
        * Added ability to override FileVersion and AssemblyInformationalVersion versions with a custom layout given a few well known variables
        * Able to find AssemblyInfo.cs in locations other than Properties folder
